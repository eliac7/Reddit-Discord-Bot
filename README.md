  <h3 align="center">What is it for? </h3>
  <p align="center">Everyone knows Reddit. It wouldn't be fun if you could have a Discord bot and bring you images from a subreddit, and not only that, you could get a maximum of 50 images? Well, yes, it is. <a href="https://github.com/D3vd/">D3vd</a>, have already implemented that on his Github and his repo with name <a href="https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api">Meme_Api</a>. So, I took advantage of it and made it to Discord, not only for memes but also for generally taking pictures from a subreddit and sending them to a channel.</p>
